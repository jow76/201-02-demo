            <section class="aboutMainText">
                <p>My name is Joe but my friends call me Jow. The nickname came about when someone misspelled my name in a Christmas card when we were kids. I think it has a nicer ring to it so I've incorporated it into my many online pseudonyms.</p>
                <p>I make music under two names - an instrumental dark ambient trap project called Sadoma and an initially-ironic-turned-lowkey-genuine cloud rap persona called Jow Rowdy. You can find my music <a class="abtLink" href="https://www.linktr.ee/jowrowdy">HERE!</a></p>
                <img class="mainImage" id="chicken" src="chicken2.jpg" alt="Joe's pet cat, Chicken">
                <p>I listen to a lot of music as well! You can follow me on <a class="abtLink" href="https://www.last.fm/user/jowsus">Last.fm</a> if you'd like! My top 3 genres are:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Metal (especially black metal)</li>
                    <li>Rap (especially cloud rap)</li>
                    <li>Rock (especially grunge and garage rock)</li>
                </ol>
                <p>I also play a lot of video games and occasionally make videos with my friends. I have multiple Youtube channels but my main one is <a class="abtLink" href="https://www.youtube.com/jowsus">this one.</a></p>
                <p>I have 1 pet - a small grey cat which 11 year old me intelligently named Chicken. Everyone else calls her Smokey but I chose the endearing nickname because I thought naming cats after their colour was unoriginal. </p>
                <p>I was born in Essex but moved to Norfolk at a very young age and am still there now. I've always been interested in computing and have found coding a fun way to be productive and creative and I hope to build a career somewhere in the coding field some day. </p>
                <p>I like cats a lot but my favourite animal is the red panda. I think my least favourite law of all time is not being allowed to own one as a pet. Then probably the law allowing slavery after that.</p>

            <h3>Top 10 Artists/Bands</h3>
            <section class="aboutMainText">
                I'm one of those people who can't make a "top 10 favourite" list to save my life but luckily I have Last.fm to tell me my top 10 artists for me (by number of listens). From top to bottom, my favourite artists are:
