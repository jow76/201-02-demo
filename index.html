            <p>Welcome to my site! My name is Joe and I am learning to code with HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I will be using this as a way to practice what I have learned and display my progress to my tutors. You can learn more about me on my "About" page.</p>

            <h3>Site Accessibility</h3>
            <p>Part of my course's lab is to check this website's accessibility rating by running it through Lighthouse on Google Chrome, then post the results here. I'm happy with a score of 91 for my personal site but understand why it is not 100. If I were making the site for a business, I would make the text easier to read against the background and will now look into the head of each page and order the elements properly.</p>
